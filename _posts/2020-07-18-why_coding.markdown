   What's the future of our human race; where are we going? I would like to believe that our world is progressing every day technologically! Computer programs, apps, robots, and electric cars are all examples of the progress we are making. There are millions of new gadgets and apps that are changing the world a little at a time. I want to be on the frontline of this progression! I want to talk to computers and apps telling them how to run a program, or how to make our lives easier. I would like to create new programs that interest new forms or expression. I want to invoke the world style and originality. I would like to be able to react with clients through code, because who likes talking on the phone?? Simply, I would love to be a pioneer in the future of our world's latest technology.
