   First, let me start by saying that this course has been one of the most challenging and rewarding courses that I have ever been a part of. I have enjoyed learning the way that computers communicate, along with how they return data. This project showed me just how difficult that can be when starting from scratch. I know that my project ahs some huge bugs and will not run quite like I want it to. 
	 Upon starting this project I realized how difficult just the configuration is. Until this assignment almost all of the labs have been configured, as well as, having specs that could help me to figure out how to slove many of the tests. I used the Coinbase API  to scrape the crypto currencies that coinbase offers to the public, along with the twenty-four hour prices of a chosen crypto currency. I have an endpoint inside my api file that will allow me to "get" these public currencies and through another file, "Crypto", create objectives that can be stored and used to show these currencies and their prices. This can be seen when the user interacts with the CLI file that greets the user, shows them a numbered list of the given crypto currencies, and upon their selection shows the open, close, high, and low prices for that crypto today. I believe that upon assesment and refacting with a cohort leader I will master this app and much of the ruby I have yet to understand.
